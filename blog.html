      <h4>1. what are the differences between arrow function and regular function?</h4>
      <p><strong><i>Answer:</i></strong>Arrow function can be written in less line of code compared to regular function.
        If one argument is passed, parentheses are not required. And also Curly brackets are not required if only one
        expression is present. Arrow function does not have argument bindings. Arrow functions doesnot support this
        keyword. Arrow functions must be excluded of duplicate named parameters whether we can use duplicate named
        parameters for regular function.</p>

      <h4>2. what are the differences between map, foreach, filter, find?</h4>
      <p><strong><i>Anser: </i></strong>Map() methods are used for creating a new array from an existing one, reflecting
        a
        condition to each one of the elements of the first array. Like map() methods, forEach() methods iterates the
        element of an array, but it doesnot return a new array.
        filter() methods are used to take each element of an array and returns the value from that array only which
        elements fullfill the conditions. On the other hand, find() method iterates the elements of an array and only
        return the first element which completes the condition.</p>

      <h4>3. what are the usage of template literals?</h4>
      <p><strong><i>Anser: </i></strong>Using template literal we can easily use multiline text what was quite tough
        before template literals. Other than that, it also supports quote inside the strings very easily. After template
        literals, string interpolation has become quite easy and readable also. Most powerfull part is, in HTML
        templates,
        we can use template string which is often used in DOM manipulation. Template literals allow expressions in
        strings
        also.</p>
